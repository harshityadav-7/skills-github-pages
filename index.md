# 🚀 Welcome to My Developer Journey

Hi, I’m Harshit Yadav — a final-year engineering student, Java full-stack developer in the making, and someone who's turning discipline, self-respect, and lifelong learning into my greatest tools.

This site is my digital corner — where you’ll find:

- 🔧 **Projects** I'm building — like *CodeOven*, an idea that’s going to empower students with automated code assessment.
- 🧠 **DSA, Java, and Backend** knowledge I’m mastering, especially with tools like Spring Boot, Hibernate, and REST APIs.
- 💬 **Real-life reflections** — on productivity, mindset, fitness, and how to live with clarity and character.
- 📸 My interests in photography, editing, and eventually YouTube — where I’ll share my journey and mentor others who started like me: uncertain but determined.

> "I’m not here just to learn tech — I’m here to build something meaningful and to become the kind of man I’d respect."

🛠 Currently:
- Preparing for private jobs until September 2025, building my skillset in communication, aptitude, and system design.
- From October onward, switching gears to **government exam prep**, reusing the mental sharpness I’ve built.
- Saying no to distractions like reels, junk food, and shallow validation.

Thanks for visiting. This site will evolve with me — just like the code I write and the habits I build.
